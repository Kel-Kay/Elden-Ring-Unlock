## Elden-Ring-Unlock
A small tool to make Elden Ring more enjoyable on PC. </br>
Tested and working with Elden Ring 1.10.
### What it does
- Removes the forced 60 hz refresh rate cap
- Changes the forced 60 fps cap to 240 fps
- Removes a call to ClipCursor when opening the map (often leading to the cursor jumping monitors and forcing the game out of focus)

### How to use
Start the game â†’ start the tool </br>
Meant to be used when launching the game offline without EAC active. </br>
